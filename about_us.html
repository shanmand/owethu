       <p>Our Speech Pathology & Audiology Practice is a holistic clinic which proudly boasts culturally and linguistically sensitive services to the diverse population in Johannesburg. Our team boasts nationally and internationally recognized personnel who continually study the most current and up to date research to be able to provide evidence-based treatment of exceptional quality to all patients in all age groups. At Johannesburg Audiology & Speech Pathology Practice (JASP), we pride ourselves in being able to establish long-term relationships with our patients where ethical practice, integrity and respect are core values. Our patients come from near and far, with a number of them coming from the rest of Africa.</p><br/>
    <ul>
    	<li>Our ENT surgeon offers treatment of the ears, nose throat, and related structures of the head and neck. Our clinic has special expertise in managing diseases of the ears, nose and nasal passage sinuses, larynx (voice box), oral cavity and upper pharynx (mouth and throat), as well as structures of the neck and face. We assess and treat all general ENT conditions such as infections in the ear, nose and throat, bleeding nose, impacted wax and removal of foreign bodies in the ear and nose.</li>
    	<li>We offer treatment for all communication related disorders stemming from ear diseases and/or hearing disorders, mouth and throat related disorders, and difficulties related to disorders in the structures of the head and neck.</li>
        <li>We have a specialized hearing clinic where tinnitus (ringing in the ear), vertigo (dizziness), and decreased hearing are tested and treated, with close collaboration with an ENT Surgeon. We have state of the science equipment for hearing screening as well as diagnostic testing in a sound-proof booth.</li>
      <li>We also treat communications problems such as delayed speech and language development, impaired speech and language following strokes and head injury, etc.</li>
        <li>We also treat feeding and swallowing problems in children and adults.</li>
        <li>We also do all the above for medico-legal and workmen's compensation purposes where we conduct assessments based on referrals by the legal fraternity for medico-legal purposes.</li>
    </ul><br/>
    <p>We have convenient referral centers for specialized services such as ENT, peadiatricians, neurologists imaging (video fluoroscopy for swallowing assessments, milk scans), etc. Our services are packaged for the convenience of the patient and family with consulting times that are flexible, and consider the working patient as well as the school-going patient.</p><br/>
    <p>We strive to provide assessment and treatment within a day, and/or within a week at the most, with consultation times including Saturday mornings.</p><br>
    <p>We see both outpatients (in consulting rooms) and in-patients (at affiliated private clinics/hospitals) as listed <a href="contact.html">here</a>.</p>
